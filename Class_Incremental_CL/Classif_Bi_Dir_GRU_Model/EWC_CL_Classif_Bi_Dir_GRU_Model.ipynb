    "    1. **Input Assumption**:\n",
    "    - The input DataFrame already contains log return data in the specified column (`column`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Trend Tracking**:\n",
    "    - Uses dictionaries to monitor trends:\n",
    "        - `dic1`: Tracks the first phase of the trend.\n",
    "        - `dic2`: Tracks the second phase if a reversal occurs.\n",
    "        - `dic3`: Tracks the third phase if another reversal occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Cumulative Product**:\n",
    "    - Calculates the cumulative product of `(1 + log_return)` from the specified column to evaluate the strength of trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Reversal Handling**:\n",
    "    - If a trend reversal persists beyond `reverse_steps`, labels are assigned based on the cumulative product tracked in `dic1`.\n",
    "    - Subsequent reversals are merged or labeled independently if conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Label Assignment**:\n",
    "    - Labels are dynamically assigned based on cumulative product thresholds for positive and negative trends:\n",
    "        - Positive trends are categorized as moderate (3) or strong (4).\n",
    "        - Negative trends are categorized as moderate (1) or strong (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. **Trend Filtering**:\n",
    "    - After detecting trends, only those specified in `trends_to_keep` remain unchanged.\n",
    "    - Any trend category not included in `trends_to_keep` is reset to 0 (No Trend).\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. **Edge Cases**:\n",
    "    - Properly handles scenarios where data points are insufficient for trend analysis or when trend phases overlap, ensuring all data points are labeled.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
